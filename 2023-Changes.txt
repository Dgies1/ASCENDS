List of major changes made this Summer, 2023 (in no order, and is not at all exhaustive. I also made tons of small changes that I cannot remember)
- Updated packages to newest compatible versions
- Implemented XGBoost training and tuning
- Hotfix native Windows installation by disabling minepy
- Implemented classificaion in GUI. Classification decided by whether the target column is categorical, which isn't a good way of determining.
- Added more descriptive error handling in GUI
- Implemented optional ordinal and one-hot encoding for categorical data, instead of relying on manually mapping
- Reworked data_load_shuffle()
- Changed input_cols to train_cols in CLI because it was easier for me to understand. It might need to be changed back though.
- Dynamically change model choices based on classification or regression.
- Try to refactor and improve some code, but I might have made it worse...
- Added ability to save raw data from correlation chart and save the history comparison bar graph in GUI
- Added lots of TODO statements. Some were notes to myself and some were features I thought should be implemented.
- Added credit to Kevin Li. I changed it to say programmed by Matt Lee and Kevin Li, but I'm not sure if this is where I was supposed to credit myself.
