# ASCENDS: Advanced data SCiEnce toolkit for Non-Data Scientists

# What is it for?

ASCENDS is a toolkit that is developed to assist scientists or any persons who want to use their data for machine learning.
We know that there are so many tools available for data scientists, but most of them require programming skills and often overwhelming.

We aim to provide a set of simple but powerful tools for non-data scientists to be able to intuitively perform various 
advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques with simple interfaces (**a command-line interface** and a web-based GUI).

The current version of ASCENDS mainly focuses on two different machine learning tasks - classification and regression (value prediction). 

* What is classification?
Users can train a predictive model (mapping function) that predicts a category (Y) from input variables (X) 
using ASCENDS. For instance, ASCENDS can train a model for predicting whether an email is spam or not-spam. 

* What is regression?
Users can train a predictive model that approximates a continuous output variable (y) from input variables (X) 
using ASCENDS. For instance, ASCENDS can train a model for predicting a value of house based on square footage, 
number of bedrooms, number of cars that can be parked in its garages, number of storages.

ASCENDS principles

- Supporting various classification/regression techniques (Linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, neural network, ...) 
- Supporting Feature selection based on various criteria
- Provides automatic hyperparameter tuning
- No programming skills required; but ASCENDS library can be used in your code if needed
- Using standard CSV (comma separated values) format data set 
- Built on top of open source projects (keras, tensorflow, scikit-learn, etc.)

Although ASCENDS has been originally developed for material scientists' research on high temperature alloy design,
the tool can be also used for many other applications.

# Getting Started: Classification

To train your first model, we are going to use the Iris data set, which is one of the classic datasets introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. 
Download the iris.csv into your data directory. (Save as the following link)

Link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev/pandas/master/pandas/tests/data/iris.csv

The Iris data set consists of 50 samples from each of 3 species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
Using ASCENDS, we will train a model that can predict a species of Iris, when new input data is given.

ASCENDS uses standard CSV (Comma Separated Values) file format,
and the file requires to have a header in the first line. The following shows the first 5 lines of the Iris data set.

```
SepalLength,SepalWidth,PetalLength,PetalWidth,Name
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.6,3.1,1.5,0.2,Iris-setosa
```
Let's try to train a classification model by executing the following command to train a classification model using ASCENDS:

```python train.py c data/iris.csv output/iris_project Name --mapping "{'Name': {'Iris-setosa':0, 'Iris-versicolor':1, 'Iris-virginica':2}}" --num_of_class 3```

`c` chooses a classification model. `data/iris.csv` refers to the file we just downloaded and placed in the data folder. 
`output/iris_project` specifies the location of the project folder we want to save our test and prediction sessions to.
ASCENDS will automatically create this directory and populate it accordingly.
`Name` is the target column name. So, ASCENDS will train a model that predicts `Name` when four other column (SepalLength,SepalWidth,PetalLength,PetalWidth) 
values are given. As we can see in the first 5 lines of data file, values for the column `Name` are not numerical. For training, we need to map
the categorical values into numerical values. This is done by using `--mapping` option. The example command will map `Iris-setosa` to 0, `Iris-versicolor` to 1, and `Iris-virginica` to 2
 for all values of column `Name`.

Then you will see, the following result.

```
$     python train.py c data/iris.csv output/iris_project Name --mapping "{'Name': {'Iris-setosa':0, 'Iris-versicolor':1, 'Iris-virginica':2}}" --num_of_class 3
Using TensorFlow backend.

 Accuracy: 0.9533333333333334
```

When training is done, ASCENDS shows an expected accuracy that is calculated via 5-fold cross validation.
The result says that expected accuracy is 95.3% (not bad!). The trained model is saved as a file (~.pkl).
Information about the training session (arguments used and model performance) are saved in `output/iris_proj/metadata.csv`
So, now let's see how the trained model file can be used for classification 
with unknown (data that has not been used for training) input data. 

(Note: the accuracy can slightly differ because the tool randomly shuffle the data set when creating folds and we used a 'Random' Forest model.)

Copy the following text into a new file and save it to `data/iris_test_input.csv`.

```
SepalLength,SepalWidth,PetalLength,PetalWidth
7.2,2.5,4.1,1.3
5.2,5.5,4.1,1.3
```

As we can see above, we don't know the name of each flower. Let's run the following:

```
$ python predict.py c output/iris_project/models/session1c_iris_RF.pkl data/iris_test_input.csv output/iris_project --mapping "{'Name': {'Iris-setosa':0, 'Iris-versicolor':1, 'Iris-virginica':2}}"
```

Executing the above command will predict category (`c`) using model `output/iris_project/models/session1c_iris_RF.pkl` for the input data `data\iris_test_input.csv` and result will be saved in `output/iris_test_prediction.csv`.
Note that we specified the trained model file we achieved ealier via ```train.py``` command.

When you open up the generated output file `output/iris_project/predictions/session1c_iris_RF_predicted.csv`,
```
,SepalLength,SepalWidth,PetalLength,PetalWidth,Name
0,7.2,2.5,4.1,1.3,Iris-versicolor
1,5.2,5.5,4.1,1.3,Iris-versicolor
```
We can see that the model thanks that both are Iris-versicolor.

# Getting Started: Regression

Let's have some fun with regression. We are going to use Boston Housing Data. Download the file from following link and save in `data/BostonHousing.csv`.
Link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/BostonHousing.csv

The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970. 
The attributes are deﬁned as follows (taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository):
- crim: per capita crime rate by town 
- zn: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. 
- indus: proportion of non-retail business acres per town 
- chas: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise) 
- nox: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million) 
- rm: average number of rooms per dwelling 
- age: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 
- dis: weighted distances to ﬁve Boston employment centers 
- rad: index of accessibility to radial highways 
- tax: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000 
- ptratio: pupil-teacher ratio by town 
- b: 1000(Bk−0.63)2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town 
- lstat: % lower status of the population 
- medv: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

The following shows how to train a regression model using ASCENDS to predict `medv`.

```
$ python train.py r data/BostonHousing.csv output/boston_proj medv

Expected MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is 2.271 and R2 (https://bit.ly/2pP83Eb) is 0.857.

Copy the following text into a new file and save it to `data/BostonHousing_test_input.csv`.

```

Similar to classification example, let's run the following:

```python predict.py r output/boston_proj/models/session1r_BostonHousing_RF.pkl data/BostonHousing_test_input.csv output/boston_proj```

(Note: the accuracy can slightly differ because the tool randomly shuffle the data set when creating folds and we used a 'Random' Forest model.)

Executing the above command will predict values (`r`) using model `output/boston_proj/models/session1r_BostonHousing_RF.pkl` for the input data `data/BostonHousing_test_input.csv` 
and resulting predictions will be saved in the `output/boston_proj` project folder.
Note that we specified the trained model file we achieved ealier via ```train.py``` command.

# Using Web-based GUI: Regression

The current version of ascends-toolkit provides a web-based GUI (graphic user interface) for regression tasks. To start the ascends-server, you need to download the source code from the repository. With ascends **Anaconda environment activated**, go to the ASCENDS directory. (If you run the ASCENDS server without activating the Anaconda environment with required packages installed, 
it will not run properly.)

Then, run the command as follows.

(ascends) slzmbpro:ascends-toolkit slz$ python ascends_server.py 
Using TensorFlow backend.

```
(ascends) $ python ascends_server.py

Once you are ready to proceed, click 'Go to ML' button to move on the machine learning test module.

![](./logo/ml_testing.png)
Within the ML tab, you can test various ML algorithms such as random forest, neural network, nearest neighbors, etc, and compare their accuracy. You can use either use a default hyper parameter setting or load a custom hyperparameter file for further optimization. For later prediction, you can save your trained model and it can be used later either with command-line interface or web-based GUI.

![](./logo/prediction.png)
Prediction tab allows you to load a file (which must have the input columns that you used for training the model you selected) and predict target column values. You can export the prediction results in various formats including csv.

# Jupyter Notebook/API Reference/Testing

Ascends-toolkit is intended to be used via command-line interface or web-based interface; however, if needed,
users may still be able to use ascends-toolkit's APIs. The following shows an example of performing a regression task using 
the core ascends-toolkit APIs. Please see [API reference](api_reference.md) for more details.
